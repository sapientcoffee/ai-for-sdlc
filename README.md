# The Gemini CLI Cookbook: Your Coffee Shop Menu ☕️

Welcome, intrepid developer! Grab your favorite mug of liquid ambition, because you've just stumbled upon the ultimate menu for the Gemini CLI.

This isn't your grandma's recipe book (unless your grandma was a command-line wizard). It's a collection of practical, real-world "recipes" designed to take you from a curious newcomer to a seasoned Gemini CLI power user. We believe that the best way to learn is by doing, so we've structured this cookbook around different **personas**, each one a specialty "barista" ready to take your order.

Just pick a persona that resonates with you and start exploring!

This is a combination of personal experiments and also crowd sourcing. I have tried to cite any inspiration I can recieved from others.

## Getting Started: The Basics

Before you order, here are a few one-time setup steps to get you started.

1.  **Login to Google Cloud:**
    `gemini auth login`

2.  **Create the `g` alias:**
    `alias g='gemini'`

3.  **Set your default model:**
    `g config set model gemini-1.5-pro`

## The Philosophy: Why the CLI? 🤔

You might be wondering, "Why all the fuss about the command line?" Great question! The short answer is: **power, speed, and flow.** The long answer is a caffeinated love letter to the terminal that explains my personal workflow philosophy.
