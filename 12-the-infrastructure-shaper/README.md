# 🧑‍💻 Persona: The Infrastructure Shaper

The "Infrastructure Shaper" is a Platform Engineer responsible for managing the company's cloud infrastructure using Terraform. Their primary goal is to ensure that the infrastructure is reliable, scalable, and secure. They spend their days writing, reviewing, and applying Terraform configurations.

## Scenario

The Infrastructure Shaper needs to streamline their daily Terraform workflow. They want to be able to quickly initialize, format, validate, and plan their Terraform changes without having to remember and type out the full commands every time. They also want a safe way to apply changes, with a clear warning before any modifications are made to the infrastructure.

This persona demonstrates how to create a set of focused slash commands to wrap the standard Terraform CLI workflow, making it faster and less error-prone.
