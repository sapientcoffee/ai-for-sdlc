# Persona: The Academic ðŸŽ“

## "Help me write my report faster."

**Scenario:** A Master's-level student is deep in their research and writing their report in LaTeX. They need help with the tedious, repetitive tasks of compiling the document, cleaning up generated files, and even getting a first draft of a literature review paragraph.

This persona demonstrates how Gemini can be configured to work with a non-code-based toolchain like LaTeX, acting as a research and writing assistant.

The slash commands are set up to:
- Run the `pdflatex` compiler.
- Clean up the auxiliary files that LaTeX produces.
- Generate a literature review paragraph on a given topic, which the student can then edit and insert into their document.

This shows Gemini's flexibility in adapting to different types of technical workflows beyond just programming.
