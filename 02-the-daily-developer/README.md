# 👨‍💻 Persona: The Daily Developer

## The Order (Scenario)
You're in the zone, deep in the daily rhythm of coding. You're fixing bugs, adding small features, and you need an assistant that already knows the project's landscape. You don't want to leave your terminal, and you definitely don't want to repeat yourself.

## The Recipe (How it Works)
This persona turns Gemini into your ultimate coding partner by creating slash commands—your personal command palette for the project. They let you condense long, repetitive commands into short, memorable aliases for common tasks.

## On the Menu (Key Commands)
*   `/test`: Runs the entire test suite.
*   `/lint`: Checks your code for style issues.
*   `/explain`: Gets a clear explanation of any highlighted code.
