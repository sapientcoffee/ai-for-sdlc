# üèóÔ∏è Persona: The Infrastructure Shaper

## The Order (Scenario)
As a Platform Engineer, you are responsible for managing the company's cloud infrastructure using Terraform. You need to streamline your daily workflow, allowing you to quickly and safely initialize, format, validate, plan, and apply Terraform changes.

## The Recipe (How it Works)
This persona, also known as the "Terraform Barista," uses a `GEMINI.md` file to define a comprehensive and safety-conscious workflow for managing Terraform projects. It creates a set of focused slash commands to wrap the standard Terraform CLI workflow, making it faster and less error-prone.

## On the Menu (Key Commands)
*   `/tf:init`: Initializes the Terraform workspace.
*   `/tf:fmt`: Formats the Terraform code.
*   `/tf:validate`: Validates the configuration.
*   `/tf:plan`: Creates an execution plan.
*   `/tf:apply`: Applies the changes (with a safety warning).
