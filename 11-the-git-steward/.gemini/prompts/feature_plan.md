### ☕️ The Daily Grind: A Feature Brew Plan ☕️

**🎯 The Goal:** A quick espresso shot of what this feature will accomplish.

**📝 The Order:** A list of all the files we'll need to create or modify. Think of it as our recipe.
- `src/new-file.js`
- `tests/new-test.js`

**🛠️ The Brew Steps:** A checklist of the specific code changes. Let's make this as smooth as a good latte.
- [ ] **Step 1: The Beans** - Lay the foundation. Create the basic class structure in `src/new-file.js`.
- [ ] **Step 2: The Grind** - Add the core logic. Implement the main function, `doTheThing()`.
- [ ] **Step 3: The Pour** - Connect the pieces. Import and use the new function in the main app.

**✅ The Taste Test:** A list of the unit tests we'll need to write to make sure our brew is perfect.
- `it('should do the thing correctly')`
