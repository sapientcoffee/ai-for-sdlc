# Operating Modes

You have two modes:

1. Plan Mode: More details about this mode are in the ## Workflow section below. You must always start and stay in plan mode without executing anything until you are told to do so.

2. Execute Mode: Once you have presented a plan to the user, incorporated their feedback, and received their explicit approval, then you execute the plan step-by-step in the order prescribed.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Prepare your git branch

- If git has been initialized, the git repo is in the root workspace folder.
- Before starting work on any issue, you must complete the following pre-planning steps in this exact order:
    1.  **Create and switch to branch:** Create a new branch named `fix-issue-[id]` where `[id]` is the GitHub issue number and check it out immediately. All subsequent work, including file creation, must happen on this branch.
    2.  **Check for existing work:** Look for an `.issue/[id]` folder. If it exists, resume work from there.
    3.  **Create issue directory:** If it doesn't exist, create one: `.issue/[id]`.
    4.  **Create `plan.json`:** Create the `plan.json` file inside the issue directory.
- Only after completing this checklist can you proceed to define the steps within `plan.json`.


### Phase 2: Create a step-by-step plan

Create a numbered step-by-step plan to perform the work in `plan.json`. When creating the plan:

1. **Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Adhere to a TDD workflow. For any new functionality or bug fix, the plan must include a step to create a failing test before the step that implements the corresponding code. Do NOT run preflight tests. Only run single tests for the files you modify.
2. **Make the steps discrete:** Each step should represent a single, logical action. For instance, modifying a single file should be a distinct step. If multiple files need changes, create a separate step for each file.
3. **Optimize for clarity and detail:** The prompts for each step must be descriptive, detailed, and unambiguous to ensure the LLM can execute them accurately and efficiently.
4. **ALWAYS finish by creating a pull request.** The final step of every `plan.json` MUST be to create a pull request merging into the main branch. Include both a concise summary of the changes and a haiku describing your work. 

Each step within `plan.json` MUST be an object containing the following keys:

- **step:** (Integer) An incremental step number starting at 1.
- **prompt:** (String) A highly descriptive and detailed prompt for the LLM to execute.
- **status:** (String) The current status of the step. The initial state should be "pending". It will be updated to "completed" or "failed" during execution.
- **time:** (String) An ISO 8601 timestamp that is updated upon completion of the step.
- **git:** (Object) An object containing git-related information:
    - **commit_message:** (String) The commit message for the step. It MUST follow the format: "[Step X] <description>", where X is the step number (e.g., "[Step 3] Refactor CatalogRepository with Java 21 features.").
    - **commit_hash:** (String) The full git commit hash after the step is successfully committed. This is initially empty.


### Phase 3: Request User Approval

**CRITICAL:** BEFORE executing any of the steps in `plan.json`, you MUST present the plan to the user and ask for approval to continue. 


### Phase 4: Step-by-Step Execution

**AFTER** the user has approved the plan, you must execute the plan sequentially in this exact order.

1. Announce the step you are about to execute (e.g., "Executing Step 1...").
2. If a step is unsuccessful:
    - Try to resolve the error
    - If you cannot resolve the error on your own, do a web search and try to find a reputable answer.
    - If you still cannot resolve the error, STOP and ask me for help. 
    - DO NOT proceed to the next step until the all preceding steps have been successful.
3. If a step requires no code changes:
    - Mark it as complete in `plan.json`
    - Commit with `--allow-empty` and a message like `[Step X] No changes required.`
4. **IMPORTANT:** After successfully completing a single step:
    - Stage the changes (`git add <changed_files>`).
    - Commit the changes with the precise message for that step (`git commit`).
    - Retrieve the commit hash (`git rev-parse HEAD`).
    - Update the corresponding step in `plan.json` with the status, timestamp, and the new commit hash.
5. Only proceed to the next step after all the prior steps have been completed successfully.
6. After completing the plan, do NOT delete the `plan.json` file. This protocol is not optional.
