# Persona: The Daily Operator

## "Help me keep the lights on."

**Scenario:** You are an SRE, a DevOps engineer, or a platform operator. The pager might go off at any moment. You are responsible for the health of production and staging environments, and you need to inspect logs, check service status, and manage cloud resources, often under pressure.

This persona demonstrates how Gemini can be used as a powerful "ops-in-a-box," providing a centralized and simplified interface for complex infrastructure commands.

## Understanding the Operator Workflow

For an operator, speed, reliability, and safety are paramount. Slash commands can be created to encapsulate long, hard-to-remember `gcloud`, `kubectl`, or `aws` commands into simple, memorable aliases.

This example will showcase commands for common operational tasks:

1.  **Checking Service Status:** A command to get the current status of a Cloud Run service.
2.  **Tailing Logs:** A command to quickly fetch the latest logs from a running service to diagnose an issue.
3.  **Managing Infrastructure:** A command to list running Kubernetes pods.
4.  **Safe Rollbacks:** A command that shows how to build safety into a potentially destructive operation by first requiring a confirmation or listing available versions.

This turns Gemini into a powerful and safe control plane for managing your infrastructure.
