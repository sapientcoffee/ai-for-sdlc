# ðŸŽ“ Persona: The Academic

## The Order (Scenario)
A Master's-level student is deep in their research and writing their report in LaTeX. They need help with the tedious, repetitive tasks of compiling the document, cleaning up generated files, and even getting a first draft of a literature review paragraph.

## The Recipe (How it Works)
This persona demonstrates how Gemini can be configured to work with a non-code-based toolchain like LaTeX, acting as a research and writing assistant. The slash commands are set up to run the compiler, clean up auxiliary files, and generate content.

## On the Menu (Key Commands)
*   `/compile`: Compiles the LaTeX report to a PDF.
*   `/clean`: Removes auxiliary files generated by LaTeX.
*   `/lit-review`: Generates a literature review paragraph on a given topic.
