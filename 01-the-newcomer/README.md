# ☕️ Persona: The Newcomer

## The Order (Scenario)
A new developer has just joined the team and needs to get up to speed on a project quickly. They want to understand the project's structure, key files, and basic commands without getting lost in lengthy documentation.

## The Recipe (How it Works)
This persona uses a `GEMINI.md` file as a "project cheat sheet" for the AI. By running the `/init` command, Gemini scans the project and generates a `GEMINI.md` file that provides a high-level overview, giving the newcomer an instant orientation.

## On the Menu (Key Commands)
*   `/init`: Scans the project and generates a `GEMINI.md` file.
